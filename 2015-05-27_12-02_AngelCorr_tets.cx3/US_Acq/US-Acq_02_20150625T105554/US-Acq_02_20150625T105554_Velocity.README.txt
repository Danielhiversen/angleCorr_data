* ==== Format description												
*																		
* All files describing one acquisition lie the same folder.  The files all have		
* the name format US-Acq_<index>_<TS><stream>.<type>,					
* where																
*  - <index> is a running index, for convenience.						
*  - <TS> is a timestamp												
*  - <stream> is the uid of the video stream. Not used prior to cx3.5.0.				
*  - <type> is the format of that specific file.										
*																		
* Together, the files contains information about the us images and their				
* timestamps, the tracking positions and their timestamps, and the probe				
* calibration.															
*																		
* In the following, we use <filebase> = US-Acq_<index>_<TS><stream>.	
*																		
*																		
* ==== <filebase>.mhd (obsolete)										
*																		
* Used prior to version cx3.4.0.										
* A file in the metaheader file format containing the uncompressed image data.			
* the z-direction is the time axis, i.e. the z dim is the number of us frames.			
* See http://www.itk.org/Wiki/MetaIO/Documentation for more.							
*																		
* Two extra tags are added:											
*																		
ConfigurationID = <path:inside:ProbeCalibConfigs.xml>					
ProbeCalibration = <not used>											
*																		
* The ConfigurationID refers to a specific configuration within		
* ProbeCalibConfigs.xml, using colon separators.						
*																		
* ==== <filebase>_<index>.mhd											
*																		
* A sequence of files in the metaheader file format containing the image data, one file
* for each frame. The frame index is given by the index in the file name.				
* See http://www.itk.org/Wiki/MetaIO/Documentation for more.							
* Replaces single image files.											
*																		
* ==== ProbeCalibConfigs.xml (obsolete)								
*																		
* This file contains the probe definition, and is copied from the		
* config/tool/Tools folder												
*																		
* ==== <filebase>.probedata.xml										
*																		
* This file contains the probe definition. Replaces ProbeCalibConfigs.xml.				
*																		
* ==== <filebase>.fts													
*																		
* This file contains the frame timestamps. This is a sequence of						
* newline-separated floating-point numbers in milliceconds. The starting point			
* is irrelevant. The number of timestamps must equal the number of us frames.			
																		
*																		
* ==== <filebase>.tp													
*																		
* This file contains the tracking positions. This is a newline-separated				
* sequence of matrices, one for each tracking sample. Each matrix is the prMt,			
* i.e. the transform from tool to patient reference.					
* The last line of the matrix (always containing 0 0 0 1) is omitted. The matrix		
* numbers is whitespace-separated with newline between rows. Thus the number of		
* lines in this file is (# tracking positions) x 3.									
*																		
*																		
* ==== <filebase>.tts													
*																		
* This file contains the tracking timestamps. The format equals .fts ,					
* but the number of timestamps equals the number of tracking positions.				
*																		
* ==== <filebase>.fp													
*																		
* This file contains the frame positions. This is a newline-separated					
* sequence of matrices, one for each US frame. Each matrix is the rMu,					
* i.e. the transform from lower-left centered image space to							
* global reference.													
* The last line of the matrix (always containing 0 0 0 1) is omitted. The matrix		
* numbers is whitespace-separated with newline between rows. Thus the number of		
* lines in this file is (# tracking positions) x 3.									
*																		
* ==== <filebase>.mask.mhd												
*																		
* This file contains the image mask. The binary image shows what parts	
* of the frame images contain valid US data. This file is only written,
* not read. It can be constructed from the probe data.
